abstract = {We explore the challenges of planning trajectories through complex environments for quadrotors. We use the RRT* algorithm to generate an initial route through a 3D environment and then construct a trajectory consisting of a sequence of polynomial spline segments to follow that route. We present a method of jointly optimizing polynomial path segments that is numerically stable for high-order polynomials and large numbers of segments, and is easily formulated for efficient sparse computation. Using a differentially flat repre- sentation of the quadrotor, these polynomial trajectories encode the complete dynamics of the vehicle and allow calculation of feed-forward control commands in closed form, eliminating the need to sample in a high-dimensional state space or carry out expensive dynamics simulations during planning. Our approach generates high-quality trajectories much faster than purely sampling-based kinodynamic planning methods, but sacrifices convergence to the global optimum. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by efficiently generating a trajectories through challenging indoor spaces and successfully traversing them at speeds up to 8m/s},

abstract = {This paper presents an integrated and practical control strategy to solve the leader-follower quadcopter formation flight control problem. To be specific, this control strategy is designed for the follower quadcopter to keep the specified formation shape and avoid the obstacles during flight. The proposed control scheme uses a hierarchical approach consisting of model predictive controller (MPC) in the upper layer with a robust feedback linearization controller in the bottom layer. The MPC controller generates the optimized collision-free state reference trajectory which satisfies all relevant constraints and robust to the input disturbances, while the robust feedback linearization controller tracks the optimal state reference and suppresses any tracking errors during the MPC update interval. In the top-layer MPC, two modifications, i.e. the control input hold and variable prediction horizon, are made and combined to allow for the practical online formation flight implementation. Furthermore, the existing MPC obstacle avoidance scheme has been extended to account for small non-apriorily known obstacles. The whole system is proved to be stable, computationally feasible and able to reach the desired formation configuration in finite time. Formation flight experiments are set up in Vicon motion-capture environment and the flight results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation flight architecture. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Franklin Institute Published by The Franklin Institute All rights reserved.},

abstract = {— Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are limited in their operation outdoors near obstacles by their ability to withstand wind gusts. Currently widespread position control methods such as Proportional Integral Derivative control do not perform well under the influence of gusts. Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) is a sensor-based control technique that can control nonlinear systems subject to disturbances. This method was developed for the attitude control of MAVs, but in this paper we generalize this method to the outer loop control of MAVs under gust loads. Significant improvements over a traditional Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller are demonstrated in an experiment where the drone flies in and out of a fan's wake. The control method does not rely on frequent position updates, so it is ready to be applied outside with standard GPS modules.},

abstract = {In the past decade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become a topic of interest in many research organizations. UAVs are finding applications in various areas ranging from military applications to traffic surveillance. This paper is a survey for a certain kind of UAV called quadrotor or quadcopter. Researchers are frequently choosing quadrotors for their research because a quadrotor can accurately and efficiently perform tasks that would be of high risk for a human pilot to perform. This paper encompasses the dynamic models of a quadrotor and the different model-dependent and model-independent control techniques and their comparison. Recently, focus has shifted to designing autonomous quadrotors. A summary of the various localization and navigation techniques has been given. Lastly, the paper investigates the potential applications of quadrotors and their role in multi-agent systems.},

abstract = {Euler-Lagrange equations and variational integrators are developed for Lagrangian mechanical systems evolving on a product of two-spheres. The geometric structure of a product of two-spheres is carefully considered in order to obtain global equations of motion. Both continuous equations of motion and variational integrators completely avoid the singularities and complexities introduced by local parameterizations or explicit constraints. We derive global expressions for the Euler-Lagrange equations on two-spheres which are more compact than existing equations written in terms of angles. Since the variational integrators are derived from Hamilton's principle, they preserve the geometric features of the dynamics such as symplecticity, momentum maps, or total energy, as well as the structure of the configuration manifold. Computational properties of the variational integrators are illustrated for several mechanical systems.},

abstract = {The complete dynamics of an aircraft, taking into account aero-elastic effects, flex-ibility of the wings, internal dynamics of the engine and the whole set of changing variables are quite complex and somewhat unmanageable for the purposes of con-trol. Therefore, it is interesting to consider a simplified model of an aircraft formed by a minimum number of states and inputs, but retaining the main features that must be considered when designing control laws for a real aircraft. This chapter deals with the modeling of a quad-rotor rotorcraft, and is organized as follows. Section 2.1 gives a general overview of the quad-rotor aerial vehicle and its operation principle. Next, Sect. 2.2 deals with the quad-rotor modeling, present-ing two different approaches: Euler–Lagrange in Sect. 2.2.1 and Newton–Euler in Sect. 2.2.2. Subsequently, it is shown in Sect. 2.2.3 how to derive Lagrange's equa-tions from Newton's equations. Section 2.2.4 presents a Newton–Euler modeling for an " X-Flyer " quad-rotor configuration. Finally, some concluding remarks are presented in Sect. 2.3. 2.1 The Quad-Rotor Mini-Rotorcraft The quad-rotor mini-rotorcraft is controlled by the angular speeds of four electric motors as shown in Fig. 2.1. Each motor produces a thrust and a torque, whose combination generates the main thrust, the yaw torque, the pitch torque, and the roll torque acting on the quad-rotor. Conventional helicopters modify the lift force by varying the collective pitch. Such aerial vehicles use a mechanical device known as swashplate. This system interconnects servomechanisms and blade pitch links in order to change the rotor blades pitch angle in a cyclic manner, so as to obtain the pitch and roll control torques of the vehicle. In contrast, the quad-rotor does not have a swashplate and has constant pitch blades. Therefore, in a quad-rotor we can only vary the angular speed of each one of the four rotors to obtain the pitch and roll control torques.},

abstract = {Attaining autonomous flight is an important task in aerial robotics. Often flight trajectories are not only subject to unknown system dynamics, but also to specific task constraints. This paper presents a motion planning method for generating trajectories with minimal residual oscillations (swing-free) for rotorcraft carrying a suspended loads. We rely on a finite-sampling, batch reinforcement learning algorithm to train the system for a particular load. We find criteria that allow the trained agent to be transferred to a variety of models, state and action spaces and produce a number of different trajectories. Through a combination of simulations and experiments, we demonstrate that the inferred policy is robust to noise and the unmodeled dynamics of the system. The contributions of this work are 1) applying reinforcement learning to solve the problem of finding swing-free trajectories for rotorcraft, 2) designing a problem-specific feature vector for value function approximation, 3) giving sufficient conditions for successful learning transfer to different models, state and action spaces, and 4) verification of the resulting trajectories in both simulation and autonomous control of quadrotors with suspended loads.},

abstract = {Rigid-body attitude control is motivated by aerospace applications that involve attitude maneuvers or attitude stabilization. The set of attitudes of a rigid body is the set of 3 X 3 orthogonal matrices whose determinant is one. This set is the configuration space of rigid-body attitude motion; however, this configuration space is not Euclidean. Since the set of attitudes is not a Euclidean space, attitude control is typically studied using various attitude parameterizations. Motivated by the desire to represent attitude both globally and uniquely in the analysis of rigid-body rotational motion, this article uses orthogonal matrices exclusively to represent attitude and to develop results on rigid-body attitude control. An advantage of using orthogonal matrices is that these control results, which include open-loop attitude control maneuvers and stabilization using continuous feedback control, do not require reinterpretation on the set of attitudes viewed as orthogonal matrices. The main objec tive of this article is to demonstrate how to characterize properties of attitude control systems for arbitrary attitude maneuvers without using attitude parameterizations.},

The present volume provides a first attempt in book form to bring together concepts and methods dealing with hybrid systems from various areas, and to look at these from a unified perspective. The authors have chosen a mode of exposition that is largely based on illustrative examples rather than on the abstract theorem-proof format because the systematic study of hybrid systems is still in its infancy. The examples are taken from many different application areas, ranging from power converters to communication protocols and from chaos to mathematical finance. Subjects covered include the following: definition of hybrid systems; description formats; existence and uniqueness of solutions; special subclasses (variable-structure systems, complementarity systems); reachability and verification; stability and stabilizability; control design methods. The book will be of interest to scientists from a wide range of disciplines including: computer science, control theory, dynamical system theory, systems modeling and simulation, and operations research.},

The translational degrees of freedom of the quadrotor are decoupled, and time-optimal trajectories are found for each degree of freedom separately. The trajectory generation is fast enough to be performed online. Control inputs are calculated from the generated trajectory, and used to achieve closed-loop control similar to model predictive control. The trajectory generation and tracking performance is demonstrated in the ETH Zurich Flying Machine Arena testbed. Experimental results show good performance, with unmodeled aerodynamic effects causing trajectory deviations when decelerating from high speeds. Development potential for the future is highlighted, focusing on improving the performance and correcting for aerodynamic effects.},

Recently, an emerging application of 3D printing also attracts researchers to use robotic manipulators in hope of gaining a higher dimension in the printing process as well as a larger workspace. The conventional method for controlling robot manipulator involves a model based feed-forward controller to eliminate the nonlinearities such as gravity and the coriolis term, combined with a feedback controller to compensate the residual error. This method, however, has a drawback in obtaining a good model of the robot. Furthermore, a robot's physical properties are subject to change over time due to, for instance, degraded gearboxes, etc. Such a problem will require the robot to re-perform a system identification which is often unacceptable due to the time it takes and the possibly dangerous movement the robot must execute. Therefore, this class of controller may not be the best option for such condition. This thesis addresses the aforementioned problem from the point of view of model-free, learning controller which improves the tracking performance safely in an online fashion. The thesis exploits the reinforcement learning (RL) technique which uses the nature of trial and errors to correct the tracking error. Improvement to the control performance is done by feeding an additive compensation signal given by a learned policy function to the robot's nominal controller. Two different compensation methods are proposed in the thesis. Both methods are realized by the so called actor-critic (AC) algorithm in order to cope with the continuous state of a robot arm. The first method compensates the control input of the nominal controller while the second method modifies the reference trajectory. The methods are implemented on a real 6 DoFs 3D printing robotic setup. For the test, three different reference tracking tasks are designed and executed. Furthermore, to provide a comparative study, two conventional control methods namely model predictive control (MPC) and iterative learning control (ILC) are implemented as well. Their results are then analysed and compared to that of the proposed RL-based controllers. The experimental result shows that the RL-based controllers improve the performance of the nominal control significantly. It is also shown that the performance of the learning controller is close to that of the model-based control method. For a circular, smooth trajectory, the experiment even shows that the RL-based controller is able to outmatch both MPC and ILC performance.},

abstract = {A new motion planning method for robots in static workspaces is$\backslash$r$\backslash$npresented. This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a$\backslash$r$\backslash$nquery phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is$\backslash$r$\backslash$nconstructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncollision-free configurations and whose edges correspond to feasible$\backslash$r$\backslash$npaths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsimple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and$\backslash$r$\backslash$ngoal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nroadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two$\backslash$r$\backslash$nnodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to$\backslash$r$\backslash$nvirtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain$\backslash$r$\backslash$nparameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndepend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these$\backslash$r$\backslash$nvalues turn out to be relatively easy to choose, Increased efficiency$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncan also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g.,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthe local planner) to the considered robots.

As a motivating example, a small and well-known nonlinear multivariable level control problem is detailed that has a number of common characteristics to larger controllers seen in practice.

We use dynamic reduction of the attitude dynamics and dynamic extension of the thrust control along with feedback linearisation to obtain a linear system of relative degree three that models force controlled position and trajectory tracking for the quadrotor. Model predictive control is then used on the feedback equivalent system and its control outputs are transformed back into the inputs for the original system. The proposed structure leads to a low complexity model predictive control algorithm that is implemented in real-time on an embedded hardware. Experimental results on different position and trajectory tracking control are presented to illustrate the application of the derived linear system and controllers.},

abstract = {Equations of motion are derived for general slung load systems. Systematic approaches have not previously been studied for deriving slung load dynamic models, but an interest in simulation, analysis, and control for slung loads carried by two or more helicopters motivates attention to this topic. Slung load systems are approximated as several rigid bodies connected by suspensions consisting of straight line cables and links which can be assumed elastic or inelastic and which transmit force only along the link. Equations for the general system are obtained from the Newton-Euler equations with the introduction of generalized speeds. Several systematic formulations are given which generalize previous case-specific results from the slung load literature or occur in the existing literature on the dynamics of multibody systems. A novel formulation is derived for inelastic suspensions from the elastic suspension equations and in which the constraint forces appear explicitly. The result is computationally more efficient for slung loads than the other formulations, is readily combined with the elastic suspension equations in a single simulation, and is readily applied to complex dual and multilift systems. The new formulation is applied to a 4-body dual lift system. Simulation equations are given along with a review of issues related to simulation of the dynamics, and numerical results.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an overview of techniques and approaches used for a load transportation system based on small size unmanned helicopters. The focus is on the control approach and on the movement of the rope connecting helicopters and load. The proposed approach is based on two control loops: an outer loop to control the translation of each helicopter in compound and an inner loop to control the orientation of helicopters. The challenge here is that in both loops the dynamics of the whole system - all helicopters and load - should be accounted for. It is shown, that for designing the outer loop controller a complex model of the helicopters and load can be replaced by a simplified model based on interconnected mass points. For designing the inner loop controller, the complete dynamics of the whole system are considered. The usage of force sensors in the ropes is proposed in order to simplify the inner loop controller and to make it robust against variations of system parameters. The presented inner loop controller is independent of the number of coupled helicopters. The outer loop controller depends on the number of helicopters. The problem of oscillations in the flexible ropes due to external disturbancies (e.g. wind gusts) is discussed and a solution based on load state observer is presented. The performance of the presented system was verified in simulations and in real flight experiments with one and three helicopters transporting the load. The worldwide first demonstration of a slung load transportation using three helicopters was performed in December 2007.},

abstract = {This thesis presents contributions to the state-of-the-art in quadrotor control, payload transportation with single and multiple quadrotors, and trajectory generation for single and multiple quadrotors. In Ch. 2 we describe a controller capable of handling large roll and pitch angles that enables a quadrotor to follow trajectories requiring large accelerations and also recover from extreme initial conditions. In Ch. 3 we describe a method that allows teams of quadrotors to work together to carry payloads that they could not carry individually. In Ch. 4 we discuss an online parameter estimation method for quadrotors transporting payloads which enables a quadrotor to use its dynamics in order to learn about the payload it is carrying and also adapt its control law in order to improve tracking performance. In Ch. 5 we present a trajectory generation method that enables quadrotors to fly through narrow gaps at various orientations and perch on inclined surfaces. Chapter 6 discusses a method for generating dynamically optimal trajectories through a series of predefined waypoints and safe corridors and Ch. 7 extends that method to enable heterogeneous quadrotor teams to quickly rearrange formations and avoid a small number of obstacles.},

@book{Smiley1964,
abstract = {One of the most cited books in mathematics, John Milnor's exposition of Morse theory has been the most important book on the subject for more than forty years. Morse theory was developed in the 1920s by mathematician Marston Morse. (Morse was on the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study, and Princeton published his Topological Methods in the Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable in the Annals of Mathematics Studies series in 1947.) One classical application of Morse theory includes the attempt to understand, with only limited information, the large-scale structure of an object. This kind of problem occurs in mathematical physics, dynamic systems, and mechanical engineering. Morse theory has received much attention in the last two decades as a result of a famous paper in which theoretical physicist Edward Witten relates Morse theory to quantum field theory. Milnor was awarded the Fields Medal (the mathematical equivalent of a Nobel Prize) in 1962 for his work in differential topology. He has since received the National Medal of Science (1967) and the Steele Prize from the American Mathematical Society twice (1982 and 2004) in recognition of his explanations of mathematical concepts across a wide range of scienti.c disciplines. The citation reads, "The phrase sublime elegance is rarely associated with mathematical exposition, but it applies to all of Milnor's writings. Reading his books, one is struck with the ease with which the subject is unfolding and it only becomes apparent after re.ection that this ease is the mark of a master." Milnor has published five books with Princeton University Press.},

More than enough material is included for a two-semester undergraduate or graduate course. The book is advanced in the sense that mathematical relations are almost always proven, in addition to being illustrated in terms of examples. These proofs are not what a mathematician would regard as rigorous, but sketch the ideas and emphasize the relations that are essential to the study of physics and related fields. This approach incorporates theorems that are usually not cited under the most general assumptions, but are tailored to the more restricted applications required by physics. For example, Stokes' theorem is usually applied by a physicist to a surface with the tacit understanding that it be simply connected. Such assumptions have been made more explicit.},

The proposed control scheme is computed based on a piecewise affine (PWA) model of the quadrotor's attitude dynamics, where the effects of the atmospheric turbulence are taken into consideration as additive disturbances. The switchings among the PWA models are ruled by the rate of the rotation angles and for each PWA system a corresponding model predictive controller is computed. The suggested algorithm is verified in experimental studies in the execution of sudden maneuvers subject to forcible wind disturbances. The quadrotor rejects the induced wind disturbances while performing accurate attitude tracking. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In particular, a new form of an adaptive control term is proposed to guarantee stability while compensating the effects of uncertainties in quadrotor dynamics. A rigorous mathematical stability proof is given. The desirable features are illustrated by numerical example and experimental results of aggressive maneuvers.},

We present a computational procedure for numerically solving this optimal control problem, based on a geometric numerical integrator referred to as a Lie group variational integrator. This computational approach preserves the Hamiltonian structure of the controlled system and the Lie group configuration manifold of the connected rigid bodies, thereby finding complex optimal maneuvers of connected rigid bodies accurately and efficiently.

This is reflected in the methodology and contributions of this thesis where some are shared by the two branches and some are specific for each branch. This first major contribution of this thesis is the development of a complete helicopter and slung load system model that is shared between the two branches. The generic slung load model can be used to model all body to body slung load suspension types and gives an intuitive and easy-to-use way of modeling and simulating different slung load suspension types. It further includes detection and response to wire slacking and tightening, it models the aerodynamic coupling between the helicopter and the load, and can be used for multi-lift systems with any combination of multiple helicopters and multiple loads. To enable slung load flight capabilities for general cargo transport, an integrated estimation and control system is developed for use on already autonomous helicopters. The estimator uses vision based updates only and needs little prior knowledge of the slung load system as it estimates the length of the suspension system together with the system states. The controller uses a combined feedforward and feedback approach to simultaneously prevent exciting swing and to actively dampen swing in the slung load. For the mine detection application an estimator is developed that provides full system state information, including slung load heading. A linear trajectory tracking controller for the generic helicopter slung load system is devised using an optimal approach and it can be tuned to any given suspension system. To generate a full system reference for the controller, a trajectory mapping algorithm is developed. It is capable of mapping a desired slung load trajectory to a feasible full state reference based on the dynamic and kinematic system behavior. The methods and algorithms developed in this thesis are validated by systematic simulation and flight testing, and the results presented throughout the thesis show very good agreement between theory and practice.},

abstract = {This paper discusses a feedback control method for incompletely restrained wire-suspended mechanisms. The incompletely restrained wire-suspended mechanism has a merit that it enables three dimensional positioning and orientating of suspended object with simple mechanism using a small number of wires. However it also has a drawback that the manipulated object is easy to swing as seen in overhead crane which is one of the simplest incompletely restrained mechanism. For this reason, anti-sway control method for incompletely restrained type mechanisms is needed. A key point of our method is exact linearization using inverse dynamics of the system. Feedback control method with exact linearization and measuring method for the suspended object are presented, and effectiveness of proposed methods are shown by an experiment. TS - RIS},

abstract = {Optimization problems in chemical engineering often involve complex systems of nonlinear DAE as the model equations. The direct multiple shooting method has been known for a while as a fast off-line method for optimization problems in ODE and later in DAE. Some factors crucial for its fast performance are briefly reviewed. The direct multiple shooting approach has been successfully adapted to the specific requirements of real-time optimization. Special strategies have been developed to effectively minimize the on-line computational effort, in which the progress of the optimization iterations is nested with the progress of the process. They use precalculated information as far as possible (e.g. Hessians, gradients and QP presolves for iterated reference trajectories) to minimize response time in case of perturbations. In typical real-time problems they have proven much faster than fast off-line strategies. Compared with an optimal feedback control computable upper bounds for the loss of optimality can be established that are small in practice. Numerical results for the Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) of a high-purity distillation column subject to parameter disturbances are presented.},

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of real time trajectory generation and tracking for nonlinear control systems. We employ a two degree of freedom approach that separates the nonlinear tracking problem into real time trajectory generation followed by local (gain-scheduled) stabilization. The central problem which we consider is how to generate, possibly with same delay, a feasible state space and input trajectory in real time from an output trajectory that is given online. We propose two algorithms that solve the real time trajectory generation problem for differentially flat systems with (possibly non-minimum phase) zero dynamics. One is based on receding horizon point to point steering, the other allows additional minimization of a cost function. Both algorithms explicitly address the tradeoff between stability and performance and we prove convergence of the algorithms for a reasonable class of output trajectories. To illustrate the application of these technologies to physical systems, we present experimental results using a vectored thrust flight control experiment built at Caltech. A brief introduction to differentially flat systems and its relationship with feedback linearization is also included.},

The ACADO Toolkit is implemented as a self-contained C++ code, while the object-oriented design allows for convenient coupling of existing optimization packages and for extending it with user-written optimization routines. We discuss details of the software design of the ACADO Toolkit 1.0 and describe its main software modules. Along with that we highlight a couple of algorithmic features, in particular its functionality to handle symbolic expressions.

@book{Smiley1964,
abstract = {One of the most cited books in mathematics, John Milnor's exposition of Morse theory has been the most important book on the subject for more than forty years. Morse theory was developed in the 1920s by mathematician Marston Morse. (Morse was on the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study, and Princeton published his Topological Methods in the Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable in the Annals of Mathematics Studies series in 1947.) One classical application of Morse theory includes the attempt to understand, with only limited information, the large-scale structure of an object. This kind of problem occurs in mathematical physics, dynamic systems, and mechanical engineering. Morse theory has received much attention in the last two decades as a result of a famous paper in which theoretical physicist Edward Witten relates Morse theory to quantum field theory. Milnor was awarded the Fields Medal (the mathematical equivalent of a Nobel Prize) in 1962 for his work in differential topology. He has since received the National Medal of Science (1967) and the Steele Prize from the American Mathematical Society twice (1982 and 2004) in recognition of his explanations of mathematical concepts across a wide range of scienti.c disciplines. The citation reads, "The phrase sublime elegance is rarely associated with mathematical exposition, but it applies to all of Milnor's writings. Reading his books, one is struck with the ease with which the subject is unfolding and it only becomes apparent after re.ection that this ease is the mark of a master." Milnor has published five books with Princeton University Press.},

In the context of attitude control of micro air vehicles, incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion only uses a control effectiveness model and uses estimates of the angular accelerations to replace the rest of the model. Thispaperprovides solutions fortwomajor challenges of incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion control: how to deal with measurement and actuator delays, andhowto deal with a changing control effectiveness. The main contributions of this article are 1) a proposed method to correctly take into account the delays occurring when deriving angular accelerations from angular rate measurements; 2) the introduction of adaptive incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion, which can estimate the control effectiveness online, eliminating the need formanualparameterestimation or tuning;and3) the incorporation of the momentum of the propellers in the controller. This controller is suitable for vehicles that experience a different control effectiveness across their flight envelope. Furthermore, this approach requires only very coarse knowledge of model parameters in advance. Real-world experiments show the high performance, disturbance rejection, and adaptiveness properties.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the kinematics of cooperative transport of payloads suspended by multiple aerial robots with cables. In such problems, it is important to determine the positions of the aerial robots to achieve a specified position and orientation of the payload. In general, this inverse kinematics problem has no solutions for the case with one or two robots and infinitely many solutions for three or more robots. However, in the case with three robots, when the tensions of the cables are also specified, this inverse kinematics problem is shown to have a finite number of solutions. In order to obtain all possible solutions, an efficient analytic algorithm based on dialytic elimination is presented in this paper. Case studies with an equilateral triangle payload and a general payload are used for demonstration. In addition, a numerical procedure is developed to determine the set of allowable tensions. Finally, an approach for stability analysis is developed, and the stability of all equilibrium configurations is analyzed.},

abstract = {? Abstract— This paper introduces the payload stabilization method for safe payload transportation. We assumed that the vehicle and the payload are connected by wires, which is called the slung-load system. For the slung-load system, the wire generates various constraint forces between the vehicle and the payload. Various types of slung-load systems can be defined by various numbers of vehicles and payloads, but in this research, we used the slung-load system that is composed of only one vehicle and one payload. To model the slung-load system, we applied the Udwadia-Kalaba equation (UKE) to account for the slung-load system with various constraint forces. To transport the payload safely to destination point from the starting point, we suggest the payload stabilization method that modifies the structure of position controller of a quad-rotor. Controller gain design processes are also performed. Lastly, using the derived system model based on the UKE, simulation and flight tests are performed to demonstrate the performance of the payload stabilization method we suggested. Additionally, a particular unmanned aerial vehicle of quad-rotor is chosen as the main platforms of the entire system due to its advantages such as simple control logic implementation and maintainability.},

abstract = {This dissertation presents nonlinear tracking control systems for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) under the influence of uncertainties. Assuming that there exist unstructured disturbances in the translational dynamics and the attitude dynamics, a geometric nonlinear adaptive controller is developed directly on the special Euclidean group. In particular, a new form of an adaptive control term is proposed to guarantee stability while compensating the effects of uncertainties in quadrotor dynamics. Next, we derived a coordinate-free form of equations of motion for a complete model of a quadrotor UAV with a payload which is connected via a flexible cable according to Lagrangian mechanics on a manifold. The flexible cable is modeled as a system of serially-connected links and has been considered in the full dynamic model. A geometric nonlinear control system is presented to asymptotically stabilize the position of the quadrotor while aligning the links to the vertical direction below the quadrotor. Finally, we focused on the dynamics and control of arbitrary number of quadrotor UAVs transporting a rigid body payload. The rigid body payload is connected to quadrotors via flexible cables. It is shown that a coordinate-free form of equations of motion can be derived for arbitrary numbers of quadrotors and links according to Lagrangian mechanics on a manifold. A geometric nonlinear controller is presented to transport the rigid body to a fixed desired position while aligning all of the links along the vertical direction. Numerical simulation and experimental results are presented and rigorous mathematical stability analysis are provided. These results will be particularly useful for aggressive load transportation that involves large deformation of the cable.},

abstract = {The underactuated system under consideration is a magnetically-suspended, differential drive robot utilizing a winch system to articulate a suspended mass. A dynamic model of the system is first constructed, and then a nonlinear, infinite-dimensional optimization algorithm is presented. The system model uses the principles of kinematic reduction to produce a mixed kinematic-dynamic model that isolates the modeling of the system actuators from the modeling of the rest of the system. In this framework, the inputs become generalized velocities instead of generalized forces facilitating real-world implementation with an embedded system. The optimization algorithm automatically deals with the complexities introduced by the nonlinear dynamics and underactuation to synthesize dynamically feasible system trajectories for a wide array of trajectory generation problems. Applying this algorithm to the mixed kinematic-dynamic model, several example problems are solved and the results are tested experimentally. The experimental results agree quite well with the theoretical showing promise in extending the capabilities of the system to utilize more advanced feedback techniques and to handle more complex, three-dimensional problems.},

This paper presents a motion planning method for generating trajectories with minimal residual oscillations (swing-free) for rotorcraft carrying a suspended loads. We rely on a finite-sampling, batch reinforcement learning algorithm to train the system for a particular load. We find criteria that allow the trained agent to be transferred to a variety of models, state and action spaces and produce a number of different trajectories. Through a combination of simulations and experiments, we demonstrate that the inferred policy is robust to noise and the unmodeled dynamics of the system. The contributions of this work are 1) applying reinforcement learning to solve the problem of finding swing-free trajectories for rotorcraft, 2) designing a problem-specific feature vector for value function approximation, 3) giving sufficient conditions for successful learning transfer to different models, state and action spaces, and 4) verification of the resulting trajectories in both simulation and autonomous control of quadrotors with suspended loads.},

The structural property of k-flatness (the case in which flat outputs depends up to the kth derivative of the inputs) is studied based on the properties of the dynamic extension algorithm and the Cartan-K¨ahler theorems on the existence of integral manifolds of exterior differential systems. In this context, it is shown that there may exist two kind of flat systems — the nonsingular and the singular cases. Since the nonsingular case contains properly the class of state-feedback linearizable systems, this induces a classification of nonlinear flat systems as state-feedback linearizable, nonsingular and singular systems, in an ascending order of complexity. Necessary and sufficient conditions of k-flatness for the nonsingular case are developed. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the singular case are also presented, although they are much more involved and are not in closed form. Examples are presented to illustrate the results},

In addition, we implement the Bug algorithm for autonomous wall-following which could optionally be selected as the substitute exploration algorithm in sparse environments where the frontier-based exploration under-performs. We incrementally build a 3D global occupancy map on-board the MAV. The map is used by the VFH+ and frontier-based exploration in dense environments, and the Bug algorithm for wall-following in sparse environments. During the exploration phase, images from the front-looking camera are transmitted over Wi-Fi to the ground station. These images are input to a large-scale visual SLAM process running off-board on the ground station. SLAM is carried out with pose-graph optimization and loop closure detection using a vocabulary tree. We improve the robustness of the pose estimation by fusing optical flow and visual odometry. Optical flow data is provided by a customized downward-looking camera integrated with a microcontroller while visual odometry measurements are derived from the front-looking stereo camera.

For differentially flat systems, it has been shown that the projection of the dynamics along the geometric path onto a linear single-input system leads to a small dimensional optimal control problem. Although the projection simplifies the problem to great extent, the resulting problem remains difficult to solve, in particular in the case of nonlinear system dynamics and time-optimal problems. This paper proposes a nonlinear change of variables, using a time transformation, to arrive at a fixed end-time optimal control problem.

The end state captures the attitude to within a rotation about the thrust axis. Trajectory generation is done by formulating the trajectory of the quadrocopter in its jerk, in discrete time, and then solving a convex optimisation problem on each decoupled axis. Convex bounds are derived to include feasibility constraints with respect to the quadrocopter's total allowable thrust and angular rates.},

abstract = {Nowadays, aerial robots or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have many applications in civilian and military fields. For example, of these applications is aerial monitoring, picking loads and moving them by different grippers. In this research, a quadrotor with a cable-suspended load with eight degrees of freedom is considered. The purpose is to control the position and attitude of the quadrotor on a desired trajectory in order to move the considered load with constant length of cable. So, the purpose of this research is proposing and designing an antiswing control algorithm for the suspended load. To this end, control and stabilization of the quadrotor are necessary for designing the antiswing controller. Furthermore, this paper is divided into two parts. In the first part, dynamics model is developed using Newton-Euler formulation, and obtained equations are verified in comparison with Lagrange approach. Consequently, a nonlinear control strategy based on dynamic model is used in order to control the position and attitude of the quadrotor. The performance of this proposed controller is evaluated by nonlinear simulations and, finally, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control strategy for the quadrotor with suspended load in various maneuvers.},

abstract = {For many applications, the control of a complex nonlinear system can be made easier by modeling the system as a collection of simplified hybrid modes, each representing a particular operating regime. An example of this is the decomposition of complex aerobatic flights into sequences of discrete maneuvers, an approach that has proven very successful for both human piloted and autonomously controlled aircraft. However, a critical step when designing such control systems is to ensure the safety and feasibility of transitions between these maneuvers. This work presents a hybrid dynamics framework for the design of guaranteed safe switching regions and is applied to a quadrotor helicopter performing an autonomous backflip. The regions are constructed using reachable sets calculated via a Hamilton-Jacobi differential game formulation, and experimental results are presented from flight tests on the STARMAC quadrotor platform.},

@article{Sreenath2013,
abstract = {We address the problem of cooperative transporta- tion of a cable-suspended payload by multiple quadrotors. In previous work, quasi-static models have been used to study this problem. However, these approaches are severely limited because they ignore the payload dynamics, and do not explicitly model the underactuation in the control problem. Thus, there are no guarantees on the payload trajectory or the cable tensions, which must be non negative. In this paper, we develop a complete dynamic model for the case when payload is a point load and for the case when the payload is a rigid body. We show in both cases the resulting system is differentially flat when the cable tensions are strictly positive.We also consider the case where the tensions are non negative (including the case with zero tensions) and establish that these systems are differentially flat hybrid systems by considering the switching dynamics induced by the unilateral tension constraints. We use the differential flatness property to find dynamically feasible trajectories for the payload+quadrotors system.We show using numerical and experimental methods that these trajectories are superior to those obtained by quasi-static models.},

Point mass approach is used to model the external load's dynamics. The resulting nonlinear equations of motion are then trimmed for straight level flights and linearized around these flight conditions. Behaviors of representative trim variable values (i.e. cable angle and longitudinal and lateral cyclic blade pitch angles) and modes (i.e. flight dynamics and load modes) are thoroughly examined while some model parameters (e.g. cable length, load mass, and equivalent flat plate area) change. These behaviors are compared to data found in the literature. Furthermore, variance constrained controllers (i.e. output variance constrained and input variance constrained controllers) are applied for control system design. These controllers' performance is examined when they are aware of the slung-load's existence and when they are not aware of the slung-load. ?? 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

However, it has received little attention in the literature so far. Flying with a suspended load can be a very challenging and sometimes hazardous task as the suspended load significantly alters the flight characteristics of the quadrotor. In order to deal with this problem, we propose a technique based on dynamic programming which ensures swing-free trajectory tracking. We start by presenting the mathematical model of a quadrotor with suspended load dynamics and kinematics. A high-level planner is used to provide desired waypoints, and then a dynamic programming approach is used to generate the swing-free trajectory for the quadrotor carrying a suspended load. Effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by numerical simulations and experiments.},

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of obtaining good attitude estimates from measurements obtained from typical low cost inertial measurement units. The outputs of such systems are characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases. We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO (3) driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements. Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error. The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal group a related observer, termed the passive complementary filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online. The passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware; and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.},

abstract = {The effect of wind on small quadrotor vehicle flight control can be quite significant, and can lead to dangerous situations when operating in close proximity to obstacles or other aerial vehicles. This work seeks to improve quadrotor positioning performance by formally modeling the wind effects on quadrotor dynamics in order to estimate wind velocities in flight and control the vehicle accordingly. Models for wind disturbances, quadrotor dynamics in wind and onboard measurements are presented and an estimation algorithm is developed for the current wind velocity experienced by the vehicle. This wind estimate is used to improve positioning accuracy by both eliminating the effect of wind on the feedback position control law and adding a wind compensator to mitigate the effect of the expected wind disturbance. Simulation results are presented for multiple scenarios, and work is ongoing for implementation on board a quadrotor testbed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 by Steven Waslander.},

Further, we formulate individual robot control laws that enforce these constraints and enable the design of non-trivial payload motion plans. Finally, we propose two quality measures for motion plan design that minimize individual robot motion and maximize payload stability along the trajectory.

abstract = {Quadcopter, also known as quadrotor, is a helicopter with four rotors. The rotors are directed upwards and they are placed in a square formation with equal distance from the center of mass of the quadcopter. The quadcopter is controlled by adjusting the angular velocities of the rotors which are spun by electric motors. Quadcopter is a typical design for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) because of the simple structure. Quadcopters are used in surveillance, search and rescue, construction inspections and several other applications. Quadcopter has received considerable attention from researchers as the complex phenomena of the quadcopter has generated several areas of interest. The basic dynamical model of the quadcopter is the starting point for all of the studies but more complex aerodynamic properties has been introduced as well [1, 2]. Different control methods has been researched, including PID controllers [3, 4, 5, 6], backstepping control [7, 8], nonlinear H∞ control [9], LQR controllers [6], and nonlinear controllers with nested saturations [10, 11]. Control methods require accurate information from the position and attitude measurements performed with a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and other measuring devices, such as GPS, and sonar and laser sensors [12, 13]. The purpose of this paper is to present the basics of quadcopter modelling and control as to form a basis for further research and development in the area. This is pursued with two aims. The first aim is to study the mathematical mo del of the quadcopter dynamics. The second aim is to develop proper methods for stabilisation and trajectory control of the quadcopter. The challenge in controlling a quadcopter is that the quadcopter has six degrees of freedom but there are only four control inputs. This paper presents the differential equations of the quadcopter dynamics. They are derived from both the Newton-Euler equations and the Euler-Lagrange equations which are both used in the study of quadcopters. The behaviour of the model is examined by simulating the flight of the quadcopter. Stabilisation of the quadcopter is conducted by utilising a PD controller. The PD controller is a simple con trol method which is easy to implement as the control method of the quadcopter. A simple heuristic method is developed to control the trajectory of the flight. Then a PD controller is integrated into the heuristic method to reduce the effect of the fluctuations in quadcopter behaviour caused by random external forces. The following section presents the mathematical model of a quadcopter. In the third section, the mathematical model is tested by simulating the quadcopter with given control inputs. The fourth section presents a PD controller to stabilise the quadcopter. In the fifth section, a heuristic method including a PD controller is presented to control the trajectory of quadcopter flight. The last section contains the conlusion of the paper.},

We develop an algorithm that enables the real-time generation of optimal trajectories through a sequence of 3-D positions and yaw angles, while ensuring safe passage through specified corridors and satisfying constraints on velocities, accelerations and inputs. A nonlinear controller ensures the faithful tracking of these trajectories. Experimental results illustrate the application of the method to fast motion (5-10 body lengths/second) in three-dimensional slalom courses.},

First, simplified equations of motions for the multi-rotor and slung load are derived. The model is then used to design a Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) that can manage the highly nonlinear dynamics whilst accounting for system constraints. The controller is shown to simultaneously track specified waypoints whilst actively damping large slung load oscillations. A Linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) controller is also derived, and control performance is compared in simulation. Results show the improved performance of the Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) controller over a larger flight envelope, including aggressive maneuvers and large slung load displacements. Computational cost remains relatively small, amenable to practical implementation. Such systems for small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) may provide significant benefit to several applications in agriculture, law enforcement and construction.},

Traditionally, graphical models have been used to represent the joint probability distribution p(y, x), where the variables y represent the attributes of the entities that we wish to predict, and the input variables x represent our observed knowledge about the entities. But modeling the joint distribution can lead to difficulties when using the rich local features that can occur in relational data, because it requires modeling the distribution p(x), which can include complex dependencies. Modeling these dependencies among inputs can lead to intractable models, but ignoring them can lead to reduced performance. A solution to this problem is to directly model the conditional distribution p(yx), which is sufficient for classification. This is the approach taken by conditional random fields Lafferty et al., 2001. A conditional random field is simply a conditional distribution p(yx) with an associated graphical structure. Because the model is conditional, dependencies among the input variables x do not need to be explicitly represented, affording the use of rich, global features of the input. For example, in natural language tasks, useful features include neighboring words and word bigrams, prefixes and suffixes, capitalization, membership in domain-specific lexicons, and semantic information from sources such as WordNet. Recently there has been an explosion of interest in CRFs, with successful applications including text processing Taskar et al., 2002, Peng and McCallum, 2004, Settles, 2005, Sha and Pereira, 2003, bioinformatics Sato and Sakakibara, 2005, Liu et al., 2005, and computer vision He et al., 2004, Kumar and Hebert, 2003. This chapter is divided into two parts. First, we present a tutorial on current training and inference techniques for conditional random fields. We discuss the important special case of linear-chain CRFs, and then we generalize these to arbitrary graphical structures. We include a brief discussion of techniques for practical CRF implementations. Second, we present an example of applying a general CRF to a practical relational learning problem. In particular, we discuss the problem of information extraction, that is, automatically building a relational database from information contained in unstructured text. Unlike linear-chain models, general CRFs can capture long distance dependencies between labels. For example, if the same name is mentioned more than once in a document, all mentions probably have the same label, and it is useful to extract them all, because each mention may contain different complementary information about the underlying entity. To represent these long-distance dependencies, we propose a skip-chain CRF, a model that jointly performs segmentation and collective labeling of extracted mentions. On a standard problem of extracting speaker names from seminar announcements, the skip-chain CRF has better performance than a linear-chain CRF.},

abstract = {This paper provides new results for control of complex flight maneuvers for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle. The flight maneuvers are defined by a concatenation of flight modes, each of which is achieved by a nonlinear controller that solves an output tracking problem. A mathematical model of the quadrotor UAV rigid body dynamics, defined on the configuration space SE(3), is introduced as a basis for the analysis. We focus on three output tracking problems, namely (1) outputs given by the vehicle attitude, (2) outputs given by the three position variables for the vehicle center of mass, and (3) output given by the three velocity variables for the vehicle center of mass. A nonlinear tracking controller is developed on the special Euclidean group SE(3) for each flight mode, and the closed loop is shown to have desirable properties that are almost global in each case. Several numerical examples, including one example in which the quadrotor recovers from being initially upside down and another example that includes switching and transitions between different flight modes, illustrate the versatility and generality of the proposed approach.},

We consider two methods of angular actuation for the quadrotor, angular velocity and torque, and ensure that the actuation does not grow unbounded as a function of the position error. The constant force disturbance is estimated through the use of a sufficiently smooth projector operator. A prototyping and testing architecture, developed to streamline the implementation and the tuning of the controller, is also described.

In this paper, we present an online active set strategy for the fast solution of parametric QPs arising in MPC. This strategy exploits solution information of the previous QP under the assumption that the active set does not change much from one QP to the next. Furthermore, we present a modification where the CPU time is limited in order to make it suitable for strict real-time applications. Its performance is demonstrated with a challenging test example comprising 240 variables and 1191 inequalities, which depends on 57 parameters and is prohibitive for explicit MPC approaches. In this example, our strategy allows CPU times of well below 100 ms per QP and was about one order of magnitude faster than a standard active set QP solver.

abstract = {A TTITUDE coordinates (sometimes also referred to as attitude parameters) are sets of coordinates {\{}x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n {\}} that completely describe the orien-tation of a rigid body relative to some reference coordinate frame. There is an infinite number of attitude coordinates to choose from. Each set has strengths and weaknesses compared to other sets. This is analogous to choosing among the infinite sets of translational coordinates such as cartesian, polar or spherical coordinates to describe a spatial position of a point. However, describing the at-titude of an object relative to some reference frame does differ in a fundamental way from describing the corresponding relative spatial position of a point. In cartesian space, the linear displacement between two spatial positions can grow arbitrarily large. On the other hand two rigid body (or coordinate frame) ori-entations can differ at most by a 180 o rotation, a finite rotational displacement. If an object rotates past 180 o , then its orientation actually starts to approach the starting angular position again. This concept of two orientations only being able to differ by finite rotations is important when designing control laws. A smart choice in attitude coordinates will be able to exploit this fact and produce a control law that is able to intelligently handle very large orientation errors. The quest for " the best rigid body orientation description " is a very fun-damental and important one. It has been studied by such great scholars as Euler, Jacobi, Hamilton, Cayley, Klein, Rodrigues and Gibbs and has led to a rich collection of elegant results. A good choice for attitude coordinates can greatly simplify the mathematics and avoid such pitfalls as mathematical and geometrical singularities or highly nonlinear kinematic differential equations. Among other things, a bad choice of attitude coordinates can artificially limit the operational range of a controlled system by requiring it to operate within the non-singular range of the chosen attitude parameters. The following list contains four truths about rigid body attitude coordinates that are listed without proof.},

@article{Brockett2014,
abstract = {Around 1970 the study of nonlinear control systems took a sharp turn. In part, this was driven by the hope for a more inclusive theory which would be applicable to various newly emerging aerospace problems lying outside the scope of linear theory, and also by the gradual realization that tools from differential geometry, and Lie theory in particular, could be seen as providing a remarkably nice fit with what seemed to be needed for the wholesale extension of linear control theory into a nonlinear setting. This paper discusses an initial phase of the development of geometric nonlinear control, including material on the broader context from which it emerged. We limit our account to developments occurring up to the early 1980s, not because the field stopped developing at that point but rather to limit the scope of the project to something manageable. Even so, because of the volume and diversity of the literature we have had to be selective, even within the given time frame.},

The controller is designed using a command filtered, vector backstepping approach. This article focuses on the trajectory tracking capability. The trajectory tracking controller generates yaw and velocity commands. A yaw controller transforms the yaw commands to yaw rate commands. The velocity and yaw rate controller generates the two actuator force and torque commands to achieve the yaw rate and velocity commands. Each controller is nonlinear to address the kinematics and vehicle dynamics. The approach guarantees exponential stability of a compensated tracking error in the sense of Lyapunov. Both the stability analysis and simulation results are included.},

Suppressing load swing could increase safety and productivity. Input shaping is a control technique that has been used to suppress vibration of flexible machines, such as robots, satellites, and cranes. To investigate the use of input shaping on helicopters, a dynamic model is formed to characterize the translational response of a model helicopter and sling load to lateral control inputs. This translational model is used to simulate point-to-point movements with and without input shaping for a range of move distances. The input-shaped movements show greatly-reduced residual swing, with only a minor increase in move time. Data from an experimental trial using a model helicopter is presented.},

The presented algorithm can compute a feasible trajectory within tens of microseconds on a laptop computer; remaining computation time can be used to itera-tively improve the trajectory. By replanning the trajectory at a high rate, the trajectory generator can be used as an implicit feedback law similar to model predictive control.

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have received an increasing amount of attention recently with many applications being actively investigated across the globe, and several related open research questions being actively pursued. Possible applications include search and rescue, disaster relief, environmental monitoring and surveillance, transportation, and construction. Transportation of cable suspended payloads using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is one such application which is the topic of this research. Autonomous transportation of objects using UAV can contribute to the safe and reliable supply of food and medicine in remote or disaster-affected areas and even in commercial delivery of goods.$\backslash$n $\backslash$nThe state-of-the-art approaches towards the slung load transportation either develop non-linear feedback control laws to stabilize the system to a predefined trajectory or employ open loop off-line trajectory planning schemes to generate optimal control inputs to the system. Most of these techniques often rely on availability of an accurate model of the system backed up with simulation results. Very few results exist which target experimental validation of the proposed method. Based on the findings of the previously conducted literature survey, it appears that the application of closed loop on-line trajectory generation and control schemes to transport a slung payload in swing free manner remains unanswered. The work in this thesis sets off to answer the research questions in this direction and address the issues that come along with experimental validation. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a promising framework, which provides the means to tackle both the trajectory generation problem and the feedback control problem in an unified manner. As a result, it forms the most important component of this thesis.$\backslash$n $\backslash$nSpecific research problem that is addressed in this thesis is to transport a cable suspended load using quadrotor from one point to another, while minimizing the swing through the use of Linear Time Invariant MPC techniques. A non-linear dynamic model for the quadrotor-slung load system is obtained and the structure within the system dynamics is exploited to decide the control strategy. Two different MPC formulations viz. MPC with integral action and MPC with delta-u formulation are simulated and compared to Linear Quadratic control with integral action which acts as a benchmark controller. Backed with simulation results, it is shown through experimental validation that it is possible to control the swing of cable suspended load using linear control techniques. MPC being an computationally expensive task, state-of-the-art fast optimization solvers such as FORCES PRO is used to achieve on-line implementation of MPC for the quadrotor-slung load system. To this end, a new software framework for implementation of MPC is developed which establishes a wireless link with the quadrotor resulting in a real-time networked control loop.},

abstract = {A possible design method for learning motion con- trol consists of using a model-based optimal control algorithm to initialize the policy of a sampling based reinforcement learning algorithm. In this paper, the initial control trajectory design is performed for a quadrotor with a cable-suspended load using the iterative LQG (iLQG) algorithm. The hybrid model of the quadrotor with the load is introduced, and four sample tasks are presented. These tasks consist of a simple waypoint task as well as a task where the quadrotor and the load have to pass through a small window. The window task requires more aggressive control, exploiting the underactuated system dynamics including system mode switches, where the load is in free fall for some period of time.},

@book{Farrell2006,
abstract = {The goal of this book is to present different methodologies of the adaptive-approximation-based control in a unified context to facilitate discussions and comparison. Some of the topics covered include: a review of typical terminology used in nonlinear system control; approximation theory; approximation structures; learning methodologies used for adaptive function approximation; the design of nonlinear control systems; analysis and synthesis of nonlinear adaptive-approximation-based control systems; higher-order systems; and the design and analysis of adaptive-approximation-based controllers as applied to a fixed-wing aircraft. The book includes two appendices, with the first giving a background knowledge for stability and control of nonlinear systems, and the second providing a useful guide for implementing and debugging adaptive-approximation-based controllers. The book is written in plain language and flows from chapter to chapter in a natural way. Each chapter concludes with a summary as well as the exercises and design problems. The book constitutes an excellent reference for scientists and engineers interested in the subject matter. It would also serve well as a text for senior undergraduate or first year graduate courses in the field.},

The cart can translate in a horizontal plane acted on by a horizontal control force while the chain pendulum can undergo complex motion in 3D due to gravity. The configuration of the system is in {\$}(\backslashSph{\^{}}2){\^{}}n \backslashtimes \backslashRe{\^{}}2{\$}. We examine the rich structure of the uncontrolled system dynamics: the equilibria of the system correspond to any one of {\$}2{\^{}}n{\$} different chain pendulum configurations and any cart location. A linearization about each equilibrium, and the corresponding controllability criterion is provided. We also show that any equilibrium can be asymptotically stabilized by using a proportional-derivative type controller, and we provide a few numerical examples.},

@article{Hoffmann2008,
abstract = {The Stanford Testbed of Autonomous Rotorcraft for Multi-Agent Control (STARMAC), a fleet of quadrotor helicopters, has been developed as a testbed for novel algorithms that enable autonomous operation of aerial vehicles. This paper develops an autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking algorithm through cluttered environments for the STARMAC platform. A system relying on a single optimization must trade off the complexity of the planned path with the rate of update of the control input. In this paper, a trajectory tracking controller for quadrotor helicopters is developed to decouple the two problems. By accepting as inputs a path of waypoints and desired velocities, the control input can be updated frequently to accurately track the desired path, while the path planning occurs as a separate process on a slower timescale. To enable the use of planning algorithms that do not consider dynamic feasibility or provide feedforward inputs, a computationally efficient algorithm using space-indexed waypoints is presented to modify the speed profile of input paths to guarantee feasibility of the planned trajectory and minimum time traversal of the planned. The algorithm is an efficient alternative to formulating a nonlinear optimization or mixed integer program. Both indoor and outdoor flight test results are presented for path tracking on the STARMAC vehicles.},

abstract = {The recent works on quadrotor have focused on more and more challenging tasks on increasingly complex systems. Systems are often augmented with slung loads, inverted pendulums or arms, and accomplish complex tasks such as going through a window, grasping, throwing or catching. Usually, controllers are designed to accomplish a specific task on a specific system using analytic solutions, so each application needs long preparations. On the other hand, the direct multiple shooting approach is able to solve complex problems without any analytic development, by using on-the-shelf optimization solver. In this paper, we show that this approach is able to solve a wide range of problems relevant to quadrotor systems, from on-line trajectory generation for quadrotors, to going through a window for a quadrotor-and-pendulum system, through manipulation tasks for a aerial manipulator.},

We consider the case when the suspended load is connected to the centre of gravity of the UAV, and the interconnected system is modeled by Kane's method. A nonlinear controller based on the backstepping technique is derived, that ensures trajectory tracking of the UAV regardless of the pendulum motion. The origin of the tracking error is proved to be globally asymptotically stable, and results are verified by simulations.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the trajectory tracking problem for quadrotor with attitude finite-time convergence via geometric approach. First, a global geometric dynamic description is presented on the special Euclidean group (SE(3)), and the trajectory tracking control is decomposed into two cascaded tracking control loops: the position tracking control loop and the attitude tracking control loop. Then, based on the fact that the attitude tracking loop is a fast loop, a finite-time controller based on the exponential coordinate is proposed to speed up the response rate of the attitude control loop, so that the artificial singularity and redundancy can be avoided. In addition, a backstepping controller is designed for the position tracking loop to construct the thrust magnitude control input for the position dynamics and the reference rotation matrix for the attitude tracking loop. Finally, the numerical simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this trajectory tracking strategy.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a framework for modeling and controlling systems described by interdependent physical laws, logic rules, and operating constraints, denoted as mixed logical dynamical (MLD) systems. These are described by linear dynamic equations subject to linear inequalities involving real and integer variables. MLD systems include linear hybrid systems, finite state machines, some classes of discrete event systems, constrained linear systems, and nonlinear systems which can be approximated by piecewise linear functions. A predictive control scheme is proposed which is able to stabilize MLD systems on desired reference trajectories while fulfilling operating constraints, and possibly take into account previous qualitative knowledge in the form of heuristic rules. Due to the presence of integer variables, the resulting on-line optimization procedures are solved through mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP), for which efficient solvers have been recently developed. Some examples and a simulation case study on a complex gas supply system are reported.},

abstract = {Planning the path of an autonomous, agile vehicle in a dynamic environment is a very complex problem, especially when the vehicle is required to use its full maneuvering capabilities. Recent efforts aimed at using randomized algorithms for planning the path of kinematic and dynamic vehicles have demonstrated considerable potential for implementation on future autonomous platforms. This paper builds upon these efforts by proposing a randomized path planning architecture for dynamical systems in the presence of {\"{i}}¿¿xed and moving obstacles. This architecture addresses the dynamic constraints on the vehicle's motion, and it provides at the same time a consistent decoupling between low-level control and motion planning. The path planning algorithm retains the convergence properties of its kinematic counterparts. System safety is also addressed in the face of {\"{i}}¿¿nite computation times by analyzing the behavior of the algorithm when the available onboard computation resources are limited, and the planning must be performed in real time. The proposed algorithm can be applied to vehicles whose dynamics are described either by ordinary differential equations or by higher-level, hybrid representations. Simulation examples involving a ground robot and a small autonomous helicopter are presented and discussed.},
