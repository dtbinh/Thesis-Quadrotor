%ADD INTRO 

The dynamics of the \a{qr}-Load system are described by the laws of kinematics and the application of Newton's laws or Lagrangian mechanics. Opposed to the classical modeling techniques, it is also possible to describe the system's configuration space as a differentiable manifold using the tools of differential geometry. \\

Considering the properties of the system, the \a{qr} is described as a rigid body with six degrees of freedom, driven by forces and moments. The motion of a rigid body can be described by a translation of the \acf{cm} and a rotation about the \a{cm}. The derived mathematical model is represented by a set of dynamic equations commonly used for rigid body displacements. 

To derive the equations of motions traditional modeling methods often parameterize the rotations in a local coordinate system. Euler angles are commonly used, however these coordinates might result in singularities. Furthermore, there are 24 sets of Euler angles, which can lead to ambiguity. In order to avoid these complexities, the dynamics of the \a{qr}-Load system can be globally expressed on the Special Orthogonal Group $SO(3)$, \textit{2-sphere} $ \mathbb{S}^2 $ and Special Euclidean Group $ SE(3) $. This leads to a compact notation of the equations of motion, making the large amount of trigonometric functions unnecessary, that Euler angles normally introduce.

The position of the body frame is described by a vector evolving on $ \mathbb{R}^3 $, and is represented with respect to the inertial frame. The orientation, also called attitude, of the body frame with respect to the inertial frame evolves on a nonlinear space, for which several methods exist to describe this, such as \textit{Euler Angles}, quaternions or rotation matrices.

The complex dynamics of the rotors and their interactions with drag and thrust forces are represented by a simplified model. 
The angular speed \lsymb{$ \omega_i $}{Angular speed of rotor $ i $} of rotor $ i $, for $ i=1,\dots,4 $, generates a force \lsymb{$ F_i $}{Force generated by rotor $ i $} parallel to the direction of the rotor axis of rotor $ i $, given by
\begin{equation}\label{key}
F_i=\left( \frac{K_vK_\tau\sqrt{2\rho A}}{K_t}\omega_i\right)^2=b\omega_i^2 
\end{equation}
where $ K_v,K_t $ are constants related to the motor properties, $ \rho $ is the density of the surrounding air, $ A $ is the area swept out by the rotor, $ K_\tau $ is a constant determined by the blade configuration and parameters, and $ b $ is the thrust factor.\\
The torque around the axis of rotor $ i $, for $ i=1,\dots,4 $, generated due to drag is given by
\begin{equation}\label{key}

\section{Geometric Mechanics}\label{sec:mod.geometric}

In this section an introduction is given about Geometric Mechanics, which is a modern description of the classical mechanics from the perspective of Differential Geometry, which is a discipline in mathematics that studies manifolds and their geometric properties, using the tools of calculus. Geometric Mechanics is used to model the \a{qr}-Load system, which is described in Section \ref{sec:mod.QRLmod}.

%ADD intro 
In Geometric Mechanics the configuration space of systems is a \textit{group manifold} instead of a Euclidean space. The kinetic and potential energies are expressed in terms of this configuration space and their tangent spaces. It explores the geometric structure of a Lagrangian- or Hamiltonian system through the concepts of vector calculus, linear algebra, differential geometry, and non-linear control theory. Geometric mechanics provides fundamental insights into the non-linear system mechanics and yields useful tools for dynamics and control theory.


***************************************\\
Mechanics studies the dynamics of physical bodies acting under forces and potential fields. 
In Lagrangian mechanics, the trajectories are obtained by finding the paths that minimize the integral of a Lagrangian over time, called the action integral. 
Rigid body dynamics are characterized by Lagrangian/Hamiltonian dynamics. The dynamics of a Lagrangian system has unique geometric properties and these are exploited to obtain Euler-Lagrange equations. The resulting intrinsic form of the Euler-Lagrange equations are more compact than equations expressed in terms of local coordinates.


%ADD PROS CONS
Problems, singularities with Euler-Angles\\
Other attitude representations, such as exponential coordinates, quaternions, or Euler
angles, can also be used following standard descriptions, but each of the representations has a disadvantage
of introducing an ambiguity or singularity.
Why charts on $ SO(3) $ \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charts_on_SO(3)}\\

Euler Angles\\
However, the definition of Euler angles is not unique and in the literature many different conventions are used. These conventions depend on the axes about which the rotations are carried out, and their sequence because rotations are not commutative. Therefore, Euler angles are never expressed in terms of the external frame, or in terms of the co-moving rotated body frame, but in a mixture. Other conventions (e.g., rotation matrix or quaternions) are used to avoid this problem.

\paragraph{Manifolds}
%ADD  manifolds
The fundamental object of differential geometry a manifold. A manifold is a mathematical space, a collection of points, that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. Examples are a plane, a ball, a torus and a sphere. Manifolds are important objects in mathematics and physics because they allow more complicated structures to be expressed and understood in terms of the relatively well-understood properties of simpler spaces. In Figure \ref{fig:mod.manifold} is illustrated that each point of an n-dimensional manifold has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to the n-dimensional Euclidean space, meaning that there is a continuous function describing the relation between these spaces.

	\caption{A manifold locally resembles a Euclidean space\label{fig:mod.manifold}}
\end{figure}

A differentiable manifold is a smooth and continuous manifold and is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow to do calculus. One can define directions, tangent spaces, and differentiable functions on such a manifold. Each point of an n-dimensional differentiable manifold has a tangent space, which is an n-dimensional Euclidean space consisting of the tangent vectors of the curves through that point. In Figure \ref{fig:mod.tspace} the manifold $ \mathbb{S}^2 $ is represented as a sphere, with a tangent space at point $ x $, denoted by $ T_x\mathbb{S}^2 $. Taking the derivative at a point on a manifold is equivalent to a tangent vector at that point. Meaning that derivatives are conceptually equivalent to an infinitesimally short tangent vector.

\end{figure}		

\subparagraph{Configuration Spaces}
Rotation matrices are used to provide a global representation of the attitude of a rigid body, by mapping a representation of vectors expressed in \BF to a representation expressed in \IF \cite{Chaturvedi2011,Murray1994}. 
The configuration of the \a{qr} attitude is a rotation matrix $ R $ in the Special Orthogonal Group $ SO(3) $ defined as
\begin{equation}\label{key}
SO(3) \triangleq \left\lbrace R\in\mathbb{R}^{3\times3}|RR^T=I_{3\times3}, det(R)=1\right\rbrace 
\end{equation}

%CHECK nodig?
%The configuration manifold for combined translational and rotational motion of a rigid body is the special Euclidean group $ SE(3) $, which is a semi-direct product of $ SO(3) $ and $ \mathbb{R}^3 $.

$ SO(3) $ is the group of all rotations about the origin of a 3-D Euclidean space, which preserves the origin, Euclidean distance and orientation.
Every rotation has a unique inverse rotation and the identity map satisfies the definition of a rotation. The elements of \textit{Lie Algebra} $ \mathfrak{so}(3) $, a property associated with $ SO(3) $, are the elements of the tangent space of $ SO(3) $ at the identity element, see Figure \ref{fig:mod.so3}. 
These elements define the relation between the rotation $ R $ and its derivative $ \dot{R} $, such that
\begin{equation}\label{key}
\dot{R} = R\hat{\Omega}
\end{equation}
$ \mathfrak{so}(3) $ is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{key}
\mathfrak{so}(3) \triangleq \left\lbrace U\in \mathbb{R}^{3\times 3}|U^T=-U\right\rbrace
\end{equation}

Where a mapping from the angular velocity vector $ \Omega\in\mathbb{R}^3 $ to $ \hat{\Omega}\in\mathfrak{so}(3) $ is defined as \cite{Murray1994}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mod.hatOmega}
\hat{\Omega}=\begin{bmatrix}
0&-\Omega_3&\Omega_2\\
\Omega_3&0&-\Omega_1\\
-\Omega_2&\Omega_1&0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
The hat map $ \hat{\cdot}:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow \mathfrak{so}(3)$ is an isomorphism between $ \mathbb{R}^3 $ and the set of $ 3\times 3 $ skew symmetric matrices.

The configuration space of the load is represented on a 2-sphere, defined as
\begin{equation}\label{key}
\mathbb{S}^2 \triangleq \left\lbrace q\in\mathbb{R}^{3}|q\cdot q=1\right\rbrace 
\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}\label{key}
%\mathbb{S}^2 \triangleq \left\lbrace (x_1, x_2, x_3)\in\mathbb{R}^{3}| \parallel (x_1, x_2, x_3)\parallel=1\right\rbrace 
%\end{equation}
%ADD sphere - tangent space - perpendicular : angular velocity
\begin{equation}\label{key}
\dot{q} = \omega\times q
\end{equation}
where $ \omega $ is the angular velocity of the suspended load.

\paragraph{Local coordinates} Euler angles are kinematically singular since the transformation from their time rates of change to the angular velocity vector is not globally defined. Furthermore, when angular errors are large, the difference in Euler angles is no longer a good metric to define the orientation error. Local coordinates often require symbolic computational tools due to complexity of multi-body systems. Hence, the error is rather written as the required rotation to get from the current to a desired orientation. As a result, the equations of motion and the control systems can be developed on a configuration manifold in a coordinate-free, compact, unambiguous manner, while singularities of local parameterization are avoided.

To illustrate the difference in configuration spaces, an example is given of a 2-link arm, where the configuration can be expressed by 2 coordinates, see in Figure \ref{fig:mod.armmanifold}. Figure \ref{fig:mod.armcartesian} represents the configuration space as a Cartesian space, where the same dots represent one of the many identical configurations. This shows that this representation suffers from singularities caused by multiple points in one representation being mapped onto a single point in another representation. Figure \ref{fig:mod.armtorus} shows the configuration space as a \textit{torus}, a manifold where every configuration is mapped uniquely onto the manifold.

\section{Quadrotor-Load Model}	\label{sec:mod.QRLmod}

In this section the model dynamics are obtained with the concepts of differential geometry. The dynamics of the \a{qr}-Load system can be described on nonlinear manifolds. The focus lies on the subsystem where the cable tension is considered to be non-zero. 

The Quadrotor-Load model is shown in Figure \ref{fig:QRLmodel}, where the unit vector \lsymb{$ q$}{Unit vector from \a{qr} to Load} gives the direction from the \a{qr} to the Load expressed in \BF.

The configuration of the \a{qr} can be described by the location of its \a{com} and its attitude, described in Euclidean space \lsymb{$ x_Q $}{Position of the  of the \a{qr} CM}$\in \mathbb{R}^3 $ and in a nonlinear space $R\in SO(3) $ respectively. Whereas the configuration of the load can also be described by its location and attitude, described in Euclidean space \lsymb{$ x_L $}{Position of the  of the \a{qr} CM}$\in \mathbb{R}^3 $ and on a two-sphere $ q\in \mathbb{S}^2 $.

The position of the \a{qr} and Load are related by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:xQ2xL}
x_Q=x_L-Lq
\end{equation}
where \lsymb{$ L $}{Length of the cable} is the length of the cable.

The attitude kinematics equation is given by
\begin{equation}\label{key}
\dot{R}=R\hat{\Omega}
\end{equation}
where $ \Omega\in\mathbb{R}^3 $ is the angular velocity represented in the body fixed frame, defined as Equation \ref{eq:mod.hatOmega}.

%LOAD ATTITUDE DYNAMICS

To develop the Euler-Lagrange equations for mechanical systems that evolve on a Lie group, an approach developed by \cite{Lee2008,Lee2005,Lee2009,Lee2011} is used, which is based on Hamilton's principle. 

The action integral is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:actionintegral}
S=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\mathcal{L}dt
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{T}-\mathcal{U} $ is the Lagrangian of the system, where $\mathcal{T},\mathcal{U}$ are the kinetic and potential energy, respectively. Hamilton's principle of least action states that the path a conservative mechanical system takes between two configurations at time $ t_1 $ and $ t_2 $, is the one for which Equation \ref{eq:actionintegral} is an extremum, stated as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:HamPr}
\delta S=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\delta\mathcal{L}dt=0
\end{equation}
where $ \delta\mathcal{L} $ is the variation of the Lagrangian. For systems with non-conservative forces and moments, Equation \ref{eq:HamPr} is extended to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:HamPrNon}
\delta S=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}(\delta W+\delta\mathcal{L})dt=0
\end{equation}
where $ \delta W $ is the virtual work. Equation \ref{eq:HamPrNon} is applied to the QR-Load system, where the configuration manifold is $ \mathbb{R}^3\times \mathbb{S}^2\times SO(3) $. With the following states
\begin{equation}\label{key}
\textbf{x}= \begin{bmatrix}x_L& \dot{x}_L& q& \omega&R&\Omega

When assuming small angle maneuvers, \textit{Euler-angles} can be used to locally parameterize the orientation of the body-fixed reference coordinate frame with respect to the inertial reference coordinate frame. Simple linear controllers are often based on a linearized dynamical model, applying this small angles assumption. 

From Newton's law follows
\begin{equation}\label{eq:newton}
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x}_Q &= v_Q\\
m_Q\dot{v}_Q &=fRe_3-m_Qge_3-Tq\\
\dot{x}_L &= v_L\\
m_L\dot{v}_L &=-m_Lge_3+Tq
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%which gives the following equation, derived in Section \ref{sec.app:loaddyn},
%\begin{equation}\label{key}
%%CHECK whether equation is correct
%(m_Q+m_L)(\dot{v}_L+ge_3)=fRe_3-m_QL\ddot{q}
%\end{equation}


Because the Euler-Angles are used, a function is required that maps a vector of the Z-X-Y Euler angles to its rotation matrix $ R\in SO(3) $, which is denoted as \cite{Mahony2012}
\begin{equation}\label{key}
R_{312}({\phi},{\theta},{\psi})=\begin{bmatrix}
c_{\psi}c_{\theta}-s_{\phi}s_{\psi}s_{\theta}&-c_{\phi}s_{\psi}&c_{\psi}s_{\theta}+c_{\theta}s_{\phi}s_{\psi}\\
c_{\theta}s_{\psi}+c_{\psi}s_{\phi}s_{\theta}&c_{\phi}c_{\psi}&s_{\psi}s_{\theta}-c_{\psi}c_{\theta}s_{\phi}\\
-c_{\phi}s_{\theta}&s_{\phi}&c_{\phi}c_{\theta}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
The Z-X-Y Euler angles to model the rotation can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:mod.modelQRtrad}. The first rotation by yaw angle $ \psi $ is around the z-axis of \IF. Next is the rotation by roll angle $ \phi $, and the last rotation is by pitch angle $ \theta $.

The unit vector $ q $ from the \a{qr} to the load is represented in \BF. Define $ \phi_L $ as the yaw-rotation of the load around the z-axis of \BF and $ \theta_L $ as the angle between the cable and the z-axis of \BF, see Figure \ref{fig:mod.modelQRLtrad}.

\section{Stability Analysis}
Lyapunov Analysis on SO3 x R3 and S2 x R3
Closed-loop full-attitude dynamics evolve on the non- Euclidean manifold SO3 x R3, while closed-loop re-
duced-attitude dynamics evolve on the non-Euclidean mani- fold S2 x R3. Since these manifolds are locally Euclidean, local stability properties of a closed-loop equilibrium solution can be assessed using standard Lyapunov methods. In ad- dition, the LaSalle invariance result and related Lyapunov results apply to closed-loop vector fields defined on these
manifolds. However, since the manifolds SO132 and S2 are compact, the radial unboundedness assumption cannot be satisfied; consequently, global asymptotic stability cannot fol- low from a Lyapunov analysis on Euclidean spaces [40], and therefore must be analyzed in alternative ways [19]–[23].\cite[p.43]{Chaturvedi2011}
