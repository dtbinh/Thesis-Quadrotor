***************************************\\
Model Validation; now it's estimation/copied from other work\\ 
System Identification

\subsection{Modeling Constraints}
There are several techniques to handle input saturation, the most popular ones are anti-windup techniques. Back-calculation is such a method for PID to activate the integrator, is this possible for NL control?

***************************************\\
\cite{Goodarzi2013a} includes uncertainties in the translational dynamics and rotational dynamics. Out of the scope, might be interesting.\\

\subsection{Hybrid Modeling}
Switching between several flight modes yields autonomous acrobatic maneuvers. Robust to switching conditions ***why?\\

\subsection{Trajectory Generation}
\subsubsection{Minimum Snap Trajectory Generation}

Trajectory can be generated by solving a \a{QP} via minimum snap generation.

Problem in smaller space with help of differential flatness.

Is able to include constraints.
