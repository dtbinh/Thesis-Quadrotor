These files originally implemented style classes for LaTeX master
thesis reports at the  
faculty of Aerospace engineering of the Delft University of Technology.

The files have been changed subsequently by MSc students and
staff members of the Delft Center for Systems and Control.

The most recent version of the style file can be found
at the DCSC website on the page

or direcly as

If you find errors in these files or if you have corrected
bugs, please contact the DCSC MSc coordinator Peter Heuberger
so that the templates can be updated.
